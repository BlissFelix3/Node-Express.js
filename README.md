# Node-Express.js-Guide
This README guide will walk you through the process of setting up an Express.js server.

### Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine.
Installing Express.js
Open a terminal or command prompt window
Create a new directory for your project
Change into the newly created directory
Run the following command to install the Express.js framework:
Copy code
npm install express

### Setting up an Express.js Server
Create a new file named index.js in your project directory.
Open the file in a text editor and add the following code to import the Express.js framework:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

### Next, define your first route. A route defines the URL path and the action to take when the path is accessed. Add the following code to create a home route:

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to Express.js');
});

Finally, start the Express.js server by adding the following code:

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Express.js server started on port 3000');
});

### Save the changes to the file and run the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

node index.js

### Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the message from your home route.

### Conclusion
This README guide has covered the basic steps to setting up an Express.js server. You can continue to build on this foundation by adding additional routes and functionality to your server.
